## :clipboard: Our Main Task
Develop and Deploy an Event Management System web application in a team of 3 or 4 students based on a selected A2 Frontend design.

Our minimum viable product (MVP) will focus on the core functionalities that are necessary to create a fully developed and functioning web application for managing events. The following items are our MVP:

| MVP Item     |Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Landing Page      | Displays a list of upcoming events with a user-friendly interface. Allows users to browse events by category.       |
| Event Details Page      | Shows detailed information about a selected event, including image, description, date, and event status.      |
| User Registration      | Form that allows users to register by providing necessary details such as name, email, password, and address.      |
| User Login & Logout      | Functionality that allows users to log in and log out. Only logged-in users can access certain features.       |
| Ticket Booking System      | Allows logged-in users to book tickets for events, input ticket quantity, and generate an order ID. |
| Event Creation     | Allows logged-in users to create events by entering event details like name, description, date, and status.       |
| User Comments      | Logged-in users can post comments on event detail pages. Comments are displayed with the commenter's name and date.     |
| Error Pages (404, 50x)     | Custom error pages for 404 (Page Not Found) and server errors (50x).       |
| Database Integration      | A functional SQLAlchemy/SQLite database that stores and manages users, events, bookings, and comments.       |
| Deployed Application      | The application is deployed on a live server and accessible to users.       |

## :rocket: Cool Tech
1. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
2. (some JavaScript)
3. Python
4. Flask (plus Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap-Flask, Flask-Login and an authentication library e.g., werkzeug or bcrypt)
5. WTForms
6. SQLAlchemy

## Database Design!
|Tables     | Description|
|-----------|--------------|
|Event table    | Contains event details|
|Booking table  | Stores ticket booking information|
|User table     | Stores user details, including login credentials|
|Comments table | Stores comments related to events|


*Our biggest challenge is to use JavaScript as little as possible*
